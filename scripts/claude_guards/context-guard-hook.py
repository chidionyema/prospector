"""context-guard-hook.py v2 — UserPromptSubmit guard against MARATHON SESSIONS.

v1 watched resident context only (250K/400K thresholds). Obsolete: with
CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=200000 the context is capped — sessions no longer
die fat, they die LONG. Measured 2026-06-10 (7d): two ~14,000-turn, ~3-day sessions
= 91% of all weekly cost at a modest ~88K median resident context.

v2.1 (2026-08-06) RETUNED against measured data. Audit of 37 prospector sessions
(`token-audit.py -Users-chidionyema`): $374.64 / 4,183 requests = $0.0896 per request,
near-constant; cost drivers cache_read 55.6% + cache_write 23.3% = 79% context
transport, output only 21.1%. Peaks cluster at 160-167K (the 200K auto-compact knee)
and only 1 of 37 sessions ever reached 170K — so the old RESIDENT_HARD=170_000 fired
about ONCE in 37 sessions and the resident "strong" path was effectively dead. Warn
130_000 -> 85_000 (the measured mean-of-medians), hard 170_000 -> 140_000 (under the
knee, so it can actually fire). Beware: peak CAN exceed the window (max seen 277,374)
when one turn dumps a lot before compaction triggers.

v2 watches session SHAPE — user-prompt count, transcript size, session age, and
resident context — and when the shape goes marathon it injects an instruction that
tells Claude to (a) write a handoff to checkpoints/LATEST.md and (b) hand the user a
one-keystroke /compact. Loss-proof either way: memory-loop.py (SessionStart hook) re-injects
checkpoints/LATEST.md into the next fresh session automatically.

Per-session state lives next to the transcript: <session>.jsonl.guard.json
Cost when it fires: ~70 tokens of injected context. Silent otherwise. Never blocks.

#: Above this, the PreToolUse half refuses ONE context-growing call per session. Same
#: number as RESIDENT_HARD on purpose: the nudge and the block must not disagree about
#: when a session is too fat, or the nudge trains you to ignore the block.
#:
#: It is one refusal, not a wall. Founder directive 2026-08-19: "have ne type sonethig is
#: friction, the goal is autonony / i should not have to nanually be involced". A guard
#: whose only escape is the founder typing `touch .../OFF` has moved the work onto the
#: founder, which is the opposite of what a guard is for -- and on 2026-08-19 it is what
#: stopped the tooling research the founder had asked for in the same session. The refusal
#: exists to make Claude stop and write the handoff. Once that is done,
#: CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW caps the context by itself and there is nothing left
#: for this half to protect.
#: DERIVED FROM THE WINDOW, NEVER HARDCODED. This number went stale twice for the same
#: reason: it was tuned against one value of CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW and the window
#: then moved. v1 set 170_000 against a 200K window and fired once in 37 sessions; v2.1 set
#: 140_000, the window later moved to 150_000, and 140_000 sits ABOVE the ~118K autocompact
#: trigger -- so autocompact always won the race and the resident path was dead AGAIN.
#: Measured 2026-08-19: a 150_000 window compacted at ~118K, and the 200_000 window's knee was
#: 160-167K. Both are ~0.79-0.80 of the window, so the trigger is a FRACTION of the window and
#: the guard reads the same env var Claude Code does.
