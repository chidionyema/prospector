"""tool-drip-guard.py — PreToolUse enforcement for the batching / delegation rules.

WHY THIS EXISTS. ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md has carried the rule for weeks:

    "Before the SECOND exploratory grep/glob/Read aimed at the same open question,
     spawn a model:'haiku' Explore subagent instead. Not 'when the search feels big'
     -- on the second call, every time. The tell that this was violated: 3+
     consecutive read-only tool calls in the main loop with no edit between them."

It is prose, so it drifts, exactly like every other status-in-a-paragraph this estate
has been burned by. `batching-compliance.py` MEASURES the violation after the money is
spent. Nothing INTERCEPTS it. This does, at the only moment where interception is
possible: PreToolUse, before the call is made.

WHAT IT BLOCKS (three rules, all mechanical, no judgement):

  1. DRIP. N consecutive read-only tool calls with no intervening edit, delegation, or
     new user prompt. Read-only = Read (whole-file), Grep, Glob, and Bash whose command
     is nothing but search/inspect verbs. A NARROW Read (offset+limit) is the sanctioned
     pattern and is exempt -- the rule targets exploration, not surgical reads.

  2. RE-READ. Reading a path already read in this context, with no write to it since.
     Re-reading is pure re-billing: 79% of spend is context transport, and the file is
     already resident.

  3. POLL. The SAME inspect question asked twice -- `tail`ing one log again, `ps`-ing for
     a job again, `gh pr checks` again -- with no productive work in between.

RULE 3 WAS ADDED 2026-08-10, AND IT IS THE EXPENSIVE ONE. On that date a session burned
~15 polls of a single background test run, and this guard, already wired at PreToolUse,
blocked none of them. Two defects, both structural:

  * A poll DISARMED the guard. `classify` returned "read" only when EVERY segment of a
    Bash command was an inspect verb, else "reset". `ps aux | grep pytest` contains `ps`,
    which was not an inspect verb, so each poll returned "reset" and ZEROED the drip
    counter. The polling did not merely evade rule 1; it rearmed it to zero each time.
  * There was no repeat detector at all. Rule 2 was gated on `tool == "Read"`, so
    `tail -25 the-same.log` fifteen times was invisible by construction.

Rule 1 measures a STREAK OF DIFFERENT READS. The actual violation is ONE IDENTICAL
QUESTION ASKED REPEATEDLY, and the two are not the same shape: polls are separated in
time by kills, edits and mutating Bash, every one of which resets a streak. Measuring the
property instead of the violation is the estate's `measure-the-violation-not-the-property`
trap, and it cost a session here.

The fix for a poll is never "poll less often". It is ONE blocking wait sized to a duration
you already know -- which is why `.state-probe` now injects the suite's measured runtime.

WHAT RESETS THE DRIP COUNTER. Any Edit/Write/NotebookEdit, any Agent spawn (delegating
IS the fix, so it must never be punished), any PRODUCTIVE Bash, and every new user prompt.
"Productive" is now the complement of inspect-or-poll, so `sleep`/`ps`/`tail` no longer
count as work done.

ESCAPE HATCHES, in the block message so they cost no round-trip to discover:
  - delegate: Agent(subagent_type="Explore", model="haiku")
  - narrow:   Read(file_path=..., offset=..., limit=...)
  - batch:    chain the shell commands with ';' into ONE Bash call
  - wait:     one blocking wait -- `gh pr checks --watch`, or a `while ...; do sleep N; done`
  - override: touch ~/.claude/state/toolguard/OFF   (kill switch, estate convention)

STATE is keyed on transcript_path, not session_id, so a subagent with its own transcript
gets its own budget -- which is the correct semantic: each context pays its own bill.

WIRING: PreToolUse (enforce) + UserPromptSubmit (reset). Both in ~/.claude/settings.json.
Exit 0 = allow. Exit 2 = block, stderr goes to the model as the reason.
NEVER raises: any internal error exits 0. A guard that breaks the session is worse than
the waste it prevents.

SELF-PROOF (enforcement that cannot detect its own removal is not enforcement -- the
graphify precedent, scripts/graphify_sweep.py:323):
    tool-drip-guard.py --check-hooks   # exit 0 iff wired in settings.json for both events
    tool-drip-guard.py --selftest      # replays the 2026-08-10 poll burst; exit 0 iff blocked
