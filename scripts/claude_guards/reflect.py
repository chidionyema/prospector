"""Mine the transcripts for the moments the founder stopped an agent, and rank what caused them.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Asked on 2026-08-17: how do we self-improve from our own transcripts, rather than writing
another memory file nobody executes?

The answer is that the labels already exist and nobody reads them. Measured on that day:

    343 transcripts, 1.2 GB
    478  "Request interrupted by user"          <- you stopped an action mid-flight
    215  "doesn't want to proceed with this"    <- you refused a tool call

Every one of those is a human saying "this exact behaviour, at this exact point, was wrong",
already attached to the trajectory that earned it. That is labelled training data. It has been
sitting on disk unread while the same mistakes were re-litigated in prose.

THE LOOP
--------
1. Find every stop event.
2. Take the tool calls that led into it - the trajectory that earned the stop.
3. Bucket them by signature and rank by how often they recur.
4. The top recurring signature becomes a RULE in rule-guard.py, which refuses it next time.
5. Re-run this. The metric is stops per 100 tool calls. If a rule worked, that number falls.

Step 5 is what makes it recursive rather than a report: the loop grades its own fixes with
the same data it learned from.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
It does not judge whether a stop was fair. A stop is evidence that the founder wanted
something different, not proof the agent was wrong. Frequency is the signal - one stop is
noise, a signature that recurs 20 times is a behaviour worth refusing.
